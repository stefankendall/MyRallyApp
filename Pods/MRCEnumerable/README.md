# MRCEnumerable

## DESCRIPTION:

MRCEnumerable is an category implementation of several useful methods from the Ruby Enumerable module, such
as collect, inject, select, detect, reject, etc, using Objective-C blocks, and a familiar syntax.

## EXAMPLES

An example of use of each extension method is available in the Tests directory, in the file named after
the extension itself.

## IN PROGRESS

This project was initially started at Railscamp 8 in Perth, and currently extends NSArray, NSDictionary, and NSSet.
Feel free to get in contact if you have any suggestions or bug reports, etc.
